                or against the computer. When a game against the computer is selected, the player
                can chose the difficulty level of the game. There are 3 options available - easy,
                medium, difficult.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e310"></a>Allow multiple pairs of users to play simultaneously</h3></div></div></div><p>Currently, the mancala application can only save the state of one game which
                limits it to allowing only two users to play. In order to extend the service and
                support a multiple number of games simultaneously, each game state should be
                preserved separatelly.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e313"></a>User Ranking</h3></div></div></div><p>Allowing multiple games at the same time asumes a bigger number of users. Adding a
                user ranking and statistics would provide the players with a better overview of
                their own performance as well as of their competitors. The statistics could be
                integrated into each user's profile, showing the amount of games he/she won or lost.
                A hall of fame listing the best 5 players of all time could be an additional
                motivation for the users.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e316"></a>User Network</h3></div></div></div><p>Building a user network allows the inegration of many additional features which
                can improve the user experience. As mentoined above, each use will have a profile
                that shows his statistics. The profile will also be visible for other players.
                Additional features could include challenging a user, chat as well as offline
                messaging.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e319"></a>Animation</h3></div></div></div><p>Adding animation and special effects to the game play would also have a positive
                impact on the user experience. An example for such special effects is animating the
                movement of the seeds or adding sound effects when a seed get into the user's
                store.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Implementation&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
